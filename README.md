how to Run project

Install Node js, Postgres Pg Admin

Install all dependencies by running command: npm i

Add create Database appointment_test in Pg Admin
you need to add your credential of postgres server for me its below mentioned.  
    host: 'localhost',
    port: 5432,
    username: "postgres",
    password: '12345',
    database: 'appointment_test',



Once you do all of this run node application using this command: npm run dev.

To test the Api Endpoints i've attached postman collection import it into your postman
ive attached sample inputs and output.

Some of Api need Improvement.
